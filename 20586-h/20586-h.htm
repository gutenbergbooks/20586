<h2>BETWEEN THE TALE-TELLING.</h2>


<p>Fancy, if you will, Gentle Reader, that, between
the intervals of tale-telling,&mdash;the Yule-log
still ruddy upon the visages of your fellow-guests
from many lands,&mdash;fancy that a quiet traveller
draws out of his side-pocket a little, well-worn
pair of books from which he reads some scrap
of verse or some melodious Christmas poem.
Fancy, too, that, beneath the inn windows, in
the snow outside, an occasional band of the
Waits strikes up an ancient carol with voice
and horn, begging, when the music is done, admittance
to the glowing warmth within doors
and a share in the plenteous cakes and ale.</p>

<p>Imagine this, if you will, and choose, from
the pages to come, whatever of old or new will
fit well into the conceit; for not a few carols or
legends lie there which have done service under
the snow-covered gables or by the crackling
wood, and which will help, with their quaint
heartiness or simple beauty, to realize the charm
of Christmas the world around,&mdash;that charm
which flows from hearty and generous good-will
towards men; which has for its inner light
the kindly desire for peace on earth.</p>

<span class="i1">To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He laid aside; and, here with us to be,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His ready Harbinger,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No war, or battle's sound<br /></span>

<h3>HALBERT AND HOB.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here is a thing that happened. Like wild beasts whelped, for den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a wild part of North England, there lived once two wild men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhabiting one homestead, neither a hovel nor hut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time out of mind their birthright: father and son, these,&mdash;but,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a son, such a father! Most wildness by degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softens away: yet, last of their line, the wildest and worst were these.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Criminals, then? Why, no: they did not murder and rob;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But give them a word, they returned a blow,&mdash;old Halbert as young Hob:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh and fierce of word, rough and savage of deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hated or feared the more&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the genuine wild-beast breed.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus were they found by the few sparse folk of the country-side;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But how fared each with other? E'en beasts couch, hide by hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a growling, grudged agreement: so father son lay curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The closelier up in their den because the last of their kind in the world.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still, beast irks beast on occasion. One Christmas night of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came father and son to words&mdash;such words! more cruel because the blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crown each word was wanting, while taunt matched gibe, and curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Competed with oath in wager, like pastime in hell,&mdash;nay, worse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pastime turned to earnest, as up there sprang at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son at the throat of the father, seized him, and held him fast.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Out of this house you go!"&mdash;there followed a hideous oath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This oven where now we bake, too hot to hold us both!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there's snow outside, there's coolness: out with you, bide a spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the drift, and save the sexton the charge of a parish shell!"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Now, the old trunk was tough, was solid as stump of oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untouched at the core by a thousand years: much less had its seventy broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One whipcord nerve in the muscly mass from neck to shoulder-blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the mountainous man, whereon his child's rash hand like a feather weighed.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nevertheless at once did the mammoth shut his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drop chin to breast, drop hands to sides, stand stiffened,&mdash;arms and thighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All of a piece&mdash;struck mute, much as a sentry stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patient to take the enemy's fire: his captain so commands.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whereat the son's wrath flew to fury at such sheer scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his puny strength by the giant eld thus acting the babe new-born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Neither will this turn serve!" yelled he. "Out with you! Trundle, log!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you cannot tramp and trudge like a man, try all-fours like a dog!"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the old man stood mute. So, logwise,&mdash;down to floor<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Pulled from his fireside place, dragged on from hearth to door,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he pushed, a very log, staircase along, until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A certain turn in the steps was reached, a yard from the house-door sill.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the father opened his eyes,&mdash;each spark of their rage extinct,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temples, late black, dead-blanched, right-hand with left-hand linked,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He faced his son submissive; when slow the accents came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were strangely mild though his son's rash hand on his neck lay all the same.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Halbert, on such a night of a Christmas long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such a cause, with such a gesture, did I drag&mdash;so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father down thus far: but, softening here, I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A voice in my heart, and stopped: you wait for an outer word.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For your own sake, not mine, soften you too! Untrod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave this last step we reach, nor brave the finger of God!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I dared not pass its lifting: I did well. I nor blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor praise you. I stopped here: Halbert, do you the same!"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straightway the son relaxed his hold of the father's throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mounted, side by side, to the room again: no note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took either of each, no sign made each to either: last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As first, in absolute silence, their Christmas-night they passed.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dawn, the father sate on, dead, in the selfsame place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an outburst blackening still the old bad fighting-face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the son crouched all a-tremble like any lamb new-yeaned.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he went to the burial, some one's staff he borrowed,&mdash;tottered and leaned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his lips were loose, not locked,&mdash;kept muttering, mumbling. "There!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his cursing and swearing!" the youngsters cried; but the elders thought, "In prayer."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A boy threw stones; he picked them up and stored them in his vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tottered, muttered, mumbled he, till he died, perhaps found rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is there a reason in nature for these hard hearts?" O Lear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a reason out of nature must turn them soft, seems clear!<br /></span>

<h3>CHRISTMAS AT SEA.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sheets were frozen hard, and they cut the naked hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The decks were like a slide, where a seaman scarce could stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind was a nor'wester, blowing squally off the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we gave her the maintops'l, and stood by to go about.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and the North;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day we hauled the frozen sheets, and got no further forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day as cold as charity, in bitter pain and dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For very life and nature, we tacked from head to head.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We gave the South a wider berth, for there the tide-race roared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So's we saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the coast-guard in his garden, with his glass against his eye.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The frost was on the village roofs as white as ocean foam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good red fires were burning bright in every 'longshore home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The windows sparkled clear, and the chimneys volleyed out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bells upon the church were rung with a mighty jovial cheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it's just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day of our adversity was blessed Christmas morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the house above the coast-guard's was the house where I was born.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My mother's silver spectacles, my father's silver hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go dancing round the china plates that stand upon the shelves.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the shadow on the household, and the son that went to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, oh, the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessed Christmas Day.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All hands to loose topgallant sails!" I heard the captain call.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"By the Lord, she'll never stand it," our first mate, Jackson, cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... "It's the one way or the other, Mr. Jackson," he replied.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As the winter's day was ending, in the entry of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I didn't wait to hear what he<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cold! <i>Wooh!</i> how cold it was! My-oh!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The goin' was as bad fer sleighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As 't was fer wagons,&mdash;and <i>both</i> ways,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And David said, as we set out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'At Christmas services was 'bout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cold and wuthless kind o' love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer up as <i>he</i> knowed of;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as fer <i>him</i>, he railly thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'At the Good Bein' up above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would think more of us&mdash;as he ought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-stayin' home on sich a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thankin' of him thataway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jawed on in an undertone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bout leavin' Lide and Jane alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on the place, and me not there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To oversee 'em, and p'pare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stuffin' for the turkey, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sass and all, you understand.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've always managed David by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jes sayin' nothin'. That was why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd chased Lide's beau away&mdash;'cause Lide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'd allus take up Perry's side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When David tackled him; and so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last Christmas was a year ago,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Er ruther 'bout a week <i>afore</i>,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">David and Perry'd quarr'l'd about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tom-fool argyment, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pap told him to "Jes git out<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O' there, and not to come no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when he went, to <i>shet the door!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he passed the winder, we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Perry, white as white could be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">March past, onhitch his hoss, and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A <i>see</i>-gyar, and lope out o' sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Lide she come to me and cried.<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But gittin' back to&mdash;where was we?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, yes&mdash;where David lectered me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All way to meetin', high and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last Christmas was a year ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer all the awful cold, they was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fair attendunce; mostly, though,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd was 'round the stoves, you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thawin' their heels and scrougin' us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef't 'adn't be'n fer the old Squire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Givin' his seat to us, as in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stompted, a-fairly perishin',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And David could 'a' got no fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd jes 'a' drapped there in his tracks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Squire, as I was tryin' to yit<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Make room fer him, says, "No; the facks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is I got to git up and git<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ithout no preachin'. Jes got word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trial fer life&mdash;can't be deferred!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out he put. And all way through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sermont&mdash;and a long one, too&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I couldn't he'p but think o' Squire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And us changed round so, and admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gintle ways&mdash;to give his warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bench up, and have to face the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I noticed David he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was needin' jabbin', I thought best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kind o' sort o' let him rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Peared like he slep' so peacefully!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then I thought o' home, and how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what the girls was doin' now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kind o' prayed, 'way in my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breshed away a tear er two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As David waked, and church was through.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By time we'd "howdyed" round, and shuck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands with the neighbors, must 'a' tuck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A half-hour longer: ever' one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-sayin' "Christmas-gift!" afore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">David er me&mdash;so we got none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But David warmed up, more and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And got so jokey-like, and had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sperits up, and 'peared so glad,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I whispered to him, "S'pose you ast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passel of 'em come and eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their dinners with us.&mdash;Girls 's got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A full-and-plenty fer the lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their kin." So David passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The invite round. And ever' seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ever' wagon-bed and sleigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was jes <i>packed</i>, as we rode away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young folks, mild er so along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-strikin' up a sleighin' song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tel David laughed and yelled, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jes whirped up and sent the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gravel flyin' thick and fast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last Christmas was a year ago.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">W'y, that-air seven-mild ja'nt we come&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jes seven mild scant from church to home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It didn't 'pear, that day, to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much furder railly 'n 'bout three.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I was purty squeamish by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time home hove in sight and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See two <i>ve</i>hickles standin' there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already. So says I, "Prepare!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All to myse'f. And presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">David he sobered; and says he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hain't that-air Squire Hanch's old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buggy," he says, "and claybank mare?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says I, "Le's git in out the cold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Your company's nigh 'bout froze." He says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whose sleigh's that-air a-standin' there?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says I, "It's no odds whose&mdash;you jes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive to the house and let us out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Cause we're jes freezin', nigh about."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, David swung up to the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out we piled. At first I heerd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jane's voice; then <i>Lide's</i>&mdash;I thought afore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reached that girl I'd jes die, shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>when</i> I reached her, wouldn't keered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much ef I had, I was so glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-kissin' her through my green veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jes excitin' her so bad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'At <i>she</i> broke down, <i>herse'f</i>&mdash;and Jane<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She</i> cried&mdash;and we all hugged again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And David&mdash;David jes turned pale!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked at the girls and then at me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at the open door&mdash;and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is old Squire Hanch in there?" says he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old Squire suddently stood in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doorway, with a sneakin' grin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is Perry Anders in there, too?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says David, limberin' all through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Lide and me both grabbed him, and<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perry stepped out and waved his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And says, "Yes, pap." And David jes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stooped and kissed Lide, and says, "I guess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mother's much to blame as you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ef <i>she</i> kin resk him, <i>I kin</i> too."<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Let every man be jolly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each room with ivy-leaves is drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And every post with holly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though some churls at our mirth repine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rank misers now do sparing shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their hall of music soundeth;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">So all things there aboundeth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The country folks themselves advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For crowdy-mutton's come out of France;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jack shall pipe, and Jill shall dance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, let us sing some roundelays<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To make our mirth the fuller.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, whilst thus inspired, we sing,<br /></span>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The damsel donned her kirtle sheen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hall was dressed with holly green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth to the wood did merry-men go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather in the mistletoe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then opened wide the baron's hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vassal, tenant, serf, and all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Power laid his rod of rule aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ceremony doffed his pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heir, with roses in his shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night might village partner choose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord underogating share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vulgar game of post-and-pair.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And general voice, the happy night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to the cottage as the crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought tidings of salvation down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire with well-dried logs supplied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went roaring up the chimney wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge hall-table's oaken face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scrubbed till it shone, the day to grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore then upon its massive board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mark to part the squire and lord.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At such high tide her savory goose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the merry masquers in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carols roared with blithesome din;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If unmelodious was the song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a hearty note and strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lists may in their mumming see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traces of ancient mystery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shirts supplied the masquerade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smutted cheeks the visors made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! what masquers richly dight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can boast of bosoms half so light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">England was merry England when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Christmas brought his sports again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Christmas broached the mightiest ale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Christmas told the merriest tale;<br /></span>

<h3>THE EPIC.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Francis Allen's on the Christmas eve,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The game of forfeits done&mdash;the girls all kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the sacred bush and past away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parson Holmes, the poet Everard Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host, and I sat round the wassail-bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then half-way ebbed: and there we held a talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How all the old honor had from Christmas gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gone, or dwindled down to some odd games<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some odd nooks like this; till I, tired out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cutting eights that day upon the pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, three times slipping from the outer edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bumped the ice into three several stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in a doze; and, half-awake, I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parson taking wide and wider sweeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now harping on the church-commissioners,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hawking at geology and schism;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until I woke, and found him settled down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the general decay of faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right through the world; "at home was little left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none abroad; there was no anchor, none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold by." Francis, laughing, clapt his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Everard's shoulder with, "I hold by him."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"And I," quoth Everard, "by the wassail-bowl."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, yes," I said, "we knew your gift that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At college; but another which you had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean of verse (for so we held it then),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What came of that?" "You know," said Frank, "he burnt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His epic, his King Arthur, some twelve books,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then to me demanding why? "Oh, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought that nothing new was said, or else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something so said 'twas nothing&mdash;that a truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks freshest in the fashion of the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knows, he has a mint of reasons: ask.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pleased <i>me</i> well enough." "Nay, nay," said Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why take the style of those heroic times?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nature brings not back the mastodon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor we those times; and why should any man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remodel models? These twelve books of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were faint Homeric echoes, nothing-worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mere chaff and draff, much better burnt." "But I,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said Francis, "picked the eleventh from this hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have it: keep a thing, its use will come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hoard it as a sugar-plum for Holmes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laughed, and I, though sleepy, like a horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hears the corn-bin open, pricked my ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I remembered Everard's college fame<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When we were freshmen: then, at my request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brought it; and the poet, little urged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, with some prelude of disparagement,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read, mouthing out his hollow oes and aes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-chested music, and to this result:<br /></span>

<h5>MORTE D'ARTHUR.</h5>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So all day long the noise of battle rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains by the winter sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until King Arthur's table, man by man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fallen in Lyonesse about their Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A broken chancel with a broken cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stood on a dark strait of barren land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one side lay the ocean, and on one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay a great water, and the moon was full.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The sequel of to-day unsolders all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goodliest fellowship of famous knights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sleep&mdash;the men I loved. I think that we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall nevermore, at any future time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking about the gardens and the halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Camelot, as in the days that were.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I perish by this people which I made,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rule once more,&mdash;but let what will be, be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That without help I cannot last till morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, therefore, take my brand, Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those old days, one summer noon, an arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding the sword&mdash;and how I rowed across<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took it, and have worn it, like a king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, whensoever I am sung or told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after time, this also shall be known:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now delay not: take Excalibur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fling him far into the middle mere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little thing may harm a wounded man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By zigzag paths and juts of pointed rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came on the shining levels of the lake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myriads of topaz-lights and jacinth-work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of subtlest jewelry. He gazed so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that dividing the swift mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In act to throw: but at the last it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to leave Excalibur concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the many-knotted water-flags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strode he back slow to the wounded King.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild water lapping on the crag."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not rendering true answer, as beseemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For surer sign had followed, either hand,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a shameful thing for men to lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then went Sir Bedivere the second time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the ridge and paced beside the mere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How curiously and strangely chased, he smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His palms together, and he cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And if, indeed, I cast the brand away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should thus be lost forever from the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What good should follow this, if this were done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it well to obey then, if a king demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An act unprofitable against himself?"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid Excalibur the second time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so strode back slow to the wounded King.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"I heard the water lapping on the crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long ripple washing in the reeds."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To whom replied King Arthur much in wrath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Authority forgets a dying king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid widowed of the power of his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bowed the will. I see thee what thou art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou, the latest left of all my knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom should meet the offices of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either from lust of gold, or like a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the third time may prosper, get thee hence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will arise and slay thee with my hands."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere and ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the bulrush-beds, and clutched the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great brand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made lightnings in the splendor of the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen where the moving isles of winter shock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night, with noises of the northern sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught him by the hilt and brandished him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times, and drew him under in the mere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightly went the other to the King.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sat rapt: it was the tone with which he read&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some modern touches here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeemed it from the charge of nothingness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else we loved the man, and prized his work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not; but we sitting as I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cock crew loud; as at that time of year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Francis, muttering, like a man ill-used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There now&mdash;that's nothing!" drew a little back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove his heel into the smouldered log,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sent a blast of sparkles up the flue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so to bed; where yet in sleep I seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sail with Arthur under looming shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Point after point; till on to dawn, when dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin to feel the truth and stir of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, methought, who waited with a crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came a bark that, blowing forward, bore<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<span class="i0">King Arthur, like a modern gentleman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stateliest port; and all the people cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Arthur is come again: he cannot die."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then those that stood upon the hills behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated "Come again, and thrice as fair;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, further inland, voices echoed, "Come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all good things, and war shall be no more."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this a hundred bells began to peal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with the sound I woke, and heard indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clear church-bells ring in the Christmas morn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In that same hour that Christ himself was born and came to light,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While Palestine was fast asleep and lay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Without one thought of day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it because those first and bless&eacute;d swains<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Were pilgrims on those plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they received the promise, for which now<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Lived there without all noise;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">They for the town prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave their flock, and in a busy talk<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All towards Bethl'em walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek their soul's great Shepherd who was come<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To bring all stragglers home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now they find him out, and, taught before,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Lamb of God adore,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That Lamb, whose days great kings and prophets wished<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The first light they beheld was bright and gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And turned their night to day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to this later light they saw in him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their day was dark and dim.<br /></span>

<h3>FROM "THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD."</h3>

<h4>AT BETHLEHEM.</h4>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So many hills arising, green and gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Earth's large round, and that one hill to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I was his bearing-place!" On Earth's wide breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many maids! and she&mdash;of all most blest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavily mounting Bethlehem, to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Mother!&mdash;Holy Maid of Galilee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hill, with the olives, and the little town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If rivers from their crystal founts flow down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If 'twas the dawn which did day's gold unbar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye were beginnings of the best we are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most we see, the highest that we know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lifting heavenward of man's life below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, though better lips ye shall not lack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffer if one of modern mood steals back&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weary and wayworn from the desert-road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of barren thought; from Hope's Dead Sea, which glowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Love's fair mirage; from the poet's haunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scholar's lamp, the statesman's scheme, the vaunt,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The failure, of all fond philosophies,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back unto Thee, back to thy olive-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy people, and thy story, and thy Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mary of Nazareth! So long agone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing us Him who made our christendom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came to save the earth, from heav'n, His home.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So many hill-sides, crowned with rugged rocks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many simple shepherds keeping flocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In many moonlit fields! but, only they&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lone, so long ago, so far away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that one winter's night, at Bethlehem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have white angels singing lauds for them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They only&mdash;hinds wrapped in the he-goat's skin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear heaven's music, bidding peace begin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only for those, of countless watching eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "Glory of the Lord" glad to arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skies to blaze with gold and silver light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seraphs by strong joy flashed into sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind, for them, with that strange song to swell,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By too much happiness incredible&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tender anthem of good times to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at their dawn&mdash;not daylight yet, ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Peace upon earth! Good-will!" sung to the strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lutes celestial. Nay, if these things<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Too bless&euml;d to believe have seemed, or seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not ours the fault, dear angels! Prove the dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waking and true! sing once again, and make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moonlight and starlight sweet for earth's sad sake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if heaven bids ye lock in silence still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conquest of peace, and coming of good-will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till times to be, then&mdash;oh, you placid sheep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, thrice-blest shepherds! suffer if we creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back through the tangled thicket of the years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To graze in your fair flock, to strain our ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With listening herdsmen, if, perchance, one note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such high singing in the fine air float;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any rock thrills yet with that great strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We did not hear, and shall not hear, again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any olive-leaf at Bethlehem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lisps still one syllable vouchsafed to them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If some stream, conscious still&mdash;some breeze&mdash;be stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With echo of th' immortal words ye heard.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What was it that ye heard? the wind of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing in cheating tones, with touches light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the palm-plumes? or, one stop outblown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of planetary music, so far flown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earthwards, that to those innocent ears 'twas brought<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which bent the mighty measure to their thought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, haply, from breast-shaped Beth-Haccarem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hill of Herod, some waft sent to them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of storming drums and trumps, at festival<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held in the Idum&aelig;an's purple hall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, it may be, some Aramaic song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of country lovers, after partings long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meeting anew, with much "good will" indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown by some swain upon his Jordan reed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, nay! your abbas back ye did not fling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each astonished ear, for swains to sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their village-verses clear; for sounds well-known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wandering breeze, or whispering trees, or tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Herod's trumpets. And ye did not gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-startled on the stars (albeit the rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that lone orb shot, sparkling, from the east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen before), for these, largest and least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were fold-lamps, lighted nightly: and ye knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far differing glory in the night's dark blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly lit with rose, and pierced with spike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of golden spear-beam. Oh, a dream, belike!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some far-fetched vision, new to peasant's sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of paradise stripped bare!&mdash;But, why thus keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secrets for them? This bar, which doth enclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better and nobler souls, why burst for those<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who supped on the parched pulse, and lapped the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each, at the same hour, dreams the same dream!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, easier still, they lied! Yet, wherefore, then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Rise, and go up to Bethlehem," and unpen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wolf and jackal all their hapless fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they might "see these things which had been told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven's own voice"? And heaven, whate'er betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreads surely somewhere, on death's farther side!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, truly, if joy's music once hath rung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prom lips of bands invisible, if any&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Be they the dead, or of the deathless many)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love and serve man, angelical befrienders,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad of his weal, and from his woe defenders,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If such, in heaven, have pity on our tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever falling with the unmending years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High cause had they, at Bethlehem, that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift the curtain of hope's hidden light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break decree of silence with love's cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreseeing how this Babe, born lowlily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should&mdash;past dispute, since now achieved is this&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring earth great gifts of blessing and of bliss;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Date, from that crib, the dynasty of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strip his misus&euml;d thunderbolts from Jove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bend to their knee Rome's C&aelig;sars, break the chain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the slave's neck; set sick hearts free again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bitterly bound by priests, and scribes, and scrolls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heal, with balm of pardon, sinking souls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should mercy to her vacant throne restore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach right to kings, and patience to the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should, from that bearing-cave, outside the khan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the kneeling cattle, rise, and be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light of all lands, and splendor of each sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun-burst of a new morn come to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet, alas! broad day, but day's white birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which promiseth; and blesseth, promising.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These from that night! What cause of wondering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that one silence of all silences<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brake into music? if, for hopes like these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels, who love us, sang that song, and show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of time's far purpose made the "great light" glow?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherefore, let whosoever will drink dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cup of faith; and think that, verily,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Not in a vision, no way otherwise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than those poor shepherds told, there did arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This portent. Being amidst their sheep and goats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lapped careless in their pasture-keeping coats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind as their drowsy beasts to what drew nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such the lulled ear, and such th' unbusied eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which ofttimes hears and sees hid things!) there spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "Glory of the Lord" around each head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke, be it deemed, o'er hill and over hollow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the inner seeing, the sense concealed, unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those plain hinds&mdash;glad, humble, and alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooding their minds, filling their hearts; around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above, below, disclosing grove and ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks, the hill, the town, the solitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondering flocks,&mdash;agaze with grass half-chewed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm-crowns, and the path to Bethlehem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sight angelic spies. And, came to them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "Angel of the Lord," visible, sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Known for the angel by his presence pure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon was written love, and peace, and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beauty passing mortal mien and face.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the Angels were no more to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-entering those gates of space,&mdash;whose key<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Love keeps on that side, and on this side death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each shepherd to the other whispering saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he should miss some lingering symphonies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that departing music, "Let us rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And go even now to Bethlehem, and spy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This which is come to pass, shewed graciously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Lord's angels." Therewith hasted they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By olive-yards, and old walls mossed and gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in close chinks, the lizard and the snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking the sunlight come, stirred, half-awake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the terraced levels of the vines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the pillared palms, along the lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lance-leaved oleanders, scented sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the pomegranate-gardens sped their feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the causeway, up the slope, they spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breast the steep path, with steps not slackening;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past David's well, past the town-wall they ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the House of Chimham, to the khan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mark them peering in, the posts between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioning&mdash;all out of breath&mdash;if birth hath been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This night, in any guest-room, high or low?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drowsy porter at the gate saith, "No!"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shooting the bars; while the packed camels shake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bells to listen, and the sleepers wake,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And to their feet the ponderous steers slow rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting from trampled fodder large mild eyes;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay! Brothers! no such thing! yet there is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder, one nigh her time, a gentle one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him that seemed her spouse&mdash;of Galilee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They toiled at sundown to our doors&mdash;but, see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No nook was here! Seek at the cave instead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shook some barley-straw to make their bed."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then to the cave they wended, and there spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which was more, if truth be testified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the pomp seen thro' proud Herod's porch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ablaze with brass, and silk, and scented torch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on Beth-Haccarem; more to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If men had known, than all the glory told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of splendid C&aelig;sar in his marbled home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the white Isle; or audience-hall at Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling princes thronged. A clay lamp swings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By twisted camel-cords, from blackened rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shewing with flickering gleams, a Child new-born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapped in a cloth, laid where the beasts at morn<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Will champ their bean-straw: in the lamp-ray dim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fresh-made Mother by Him, fostering Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With face and mien to worship, speaking naught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close at hand Joseph, and the ass, hath brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That precious twofold burden to the gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With goats, sheep, oxen, driven to shelter late:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mightier sight! Yet all sufficeth it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we will deem things be beyond our wit&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prove heaven's music true, and show heaven's way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, not by famous kings, nor with array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brazen letters on the boastful stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But "by the mouth of babes," quiet, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little beginnings planning for large ends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With other purpose than fond man attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wisdom and love, in secret fellowship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guide our world's wandering with a finger-tip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how, that night, as these did darkly see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sealed the first scrolls of earth's history,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opened what shall run till death be dead.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which babe they reverenced, bending low the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of all worshippers; and told the things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done in the plain, and played on angel's strings.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then those around wondered and worshipped, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mary heard&mdash;but wondered not&mdash;anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding this in her heart, the heart which beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood of Jesus Christ, holy and sweet.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Also, not marvelling, albeit they heard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From climes unknown; yet, surely, on high quest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of what that star proclaimed, bright on the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First of the Ram, afterwards glittering thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the watery Trigon, where, intense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It lit the Crab, and burned the Fishes pale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three Signiors, owning many a costly bale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three travelled masters, by their bearing lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lands and slaves. The Indian silk affords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a folded braid of white and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shade to their brows; rich goat-hair shawls did fold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gowns of flow'r'd white muslin, midway tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruby, turkis, emerald&mdash;stones of pride&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazed on their thumb-rings; and a pearl gleamed white<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Curled shoes of goat-skin dyed, with seed-pearls hemmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shod their brown feet; hair shorn; lids low, to think&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyes deep and wistful, as of those who drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters of hidden wisdom, night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And live twain lives, conforming as they may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In diligence, and due observances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ways of men; yet, not at one with these;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever straining past the things that seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that which is&mdash;the truth behind the dream.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is born a tinge of rosy glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the air a stir&mdash;like wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of angels in their minist'rings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tremulous motion, and a thrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with faint light the heavens fill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night's sombre clouds are slow withdrawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature cries, Awake, 'tis dawn.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">About the lonely casement<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blows fresh the breath of day;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mother, in amazement,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sees death-glooms fade away!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The blue eyes open once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more the lips have smiled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her tears fell like the spring-time rain:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God gives her back her child!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hush, there are footsteps on the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pause the lattice-pane below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While voices chant the carol-rhymes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christmas song of olden times:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on the hill-tops crowned with snows,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As wider still the warm light glows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flooding daylight falls again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From cloud to hill&mdash;from hill to plain.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A golden sea of swimming light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured o'er the sombre shores of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the glad mother, to her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her child yet close and closer pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rescued treasure&mdash;newly born&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her babe&mdash;given back on Christmas morn.<br /></span>

<p><b>Transcriber's Notes:</b></p>

<p>A number of the poems contain archaic and varied spelling. This has
been left as printed, with the exception of the following few printer
errors:</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>&mdash;nothin.' amended to nothin'.&mdash;"Jes sayin' nothin'. That was
why ..."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_59">59</a>&mdash;joyfulst amended to joyful'st&mdash;"So, now is come our joyful'st
feast,"</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_70">70</a>&mdash;convivo amended to convivio&mdash;"Quot estis in convivio."</p>

<p>Illustrations have been shifted slightly, so that they are not in the
middle of poems. Captions have been added from the List of Illustrations.
The first illustration was located as a frontispiece in the book, but has been
moved closer to the page number given in the List of Illustrations here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_97">97</a> contains the line "Bears home the huge unwieldly
logs,"&mdash;unwieldly may or may not be a printer error, so it has been
left as printed.</p>
